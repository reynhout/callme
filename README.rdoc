= callme

A simple Ruby 1.9 demo C extension with a callback.

Extracted from an attempt to write a Ruby interface to Apache ZooKeeper.

== Status

Not working as expected, looking for assistance.

== Usage

Create a localized Makefile

  ruby1.9 extconf.rb

Build the library

  make

Pick a set of runtime options in runcallme.rb.  The following is the most relevant to my testing, but the other permutations might reveal interesting bits too.

  USE_RUBY_THREADS = false
  USE_C_THREADS = true
  USE_RUBY_CALLBACK = true

== Thanks for any help!
