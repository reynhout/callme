= callme

A simple Ruby 1.9 demo C extension with a callback.

Extracted from ongoing efforts to write a Ruby interface to Apache ZooKeeper (github link soon).

There are three demos here, two using straight C extensions and one using ruby-ffi.


== Status

The C ext variations are working properly.  The ruby-ffi variation works, but doesn't use FFI fully...and I've temporarily broken the build for use under JRuby.

MRI + ruby-ffi is the environment I am most interested in, but the other examples might also be useful as sample code, as this area seems somewhat thinly documented.  (Bug/bad style reports welcome!)


== Usage

=== C extension variations

Create a localized Makefile, build the C lib, then run the Ruby code

  ruby1.9 extconf.rb
  make
  ruby1.9 runcallme.rb


=== ruby-ffi variation

Install ruby-ffi from Mercurial repo (0.4.0, presently not released/rubygem'ed)

  hg clone https://kenai.com/hg/ruby-ffi~mercurial
  cd ruby-ffi~mercurial
  rake1.9 gem
  gem1.9 install pkg/ffi-0.4.0.gem

Create a localized Makefile, build the C lib, then run the Ruby code

  ruby1.9 extconf.rb
  make
  ruby1.9 runcallme.rb

To run under JRuby (you might need to make with MODEL=64 to build 64bit libs)

  jruby runcallme.rb

(This is the unfinished part -- FFI shouldn't require this extconf stuff...and JRuby won't even run presently due to the inappropriate build...WIP)


== History

This started out as an attempt to make Apache ZooKeeper play with Ruby, via FFI.  Everything was going well until I tried the asynchronous functions with callbacks.  Sometimes the ruby code would appear to hang, sometimes the interpreter would crash.

I backed up a bit and wrote some sample code, still using FFI but not trying to talk to ZooKeeper.  Same problems.  This code is the FFI_lib version in this repo.

Then I decided to go straight to a C ext to see if I was using FFI incorrectly.  This code is the C_ext version in this repo.
